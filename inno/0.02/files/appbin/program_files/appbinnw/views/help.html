Appbin current version: 0.02 (alpha)

<p>While appbin always backs up your settings to the cloud, to actually get settings from the cloud you need to close all applications opened by appbin and the appbin client itself.</p>

<p>The 'In Sync' currently on display is only to inform you that your applications are being monitored for sync. They don't show the current sync status.</p>

<p>Some of the apps currently point to their web pages. This is Yash, one of the developers here, being himself and will be fixed very soon</p>.

Some things we are currently working on:
<ol>
<li> Use Volume Shadow Copy for copying </li>
<li> Improve syncing </li>
<li> Get more 'actual' apps </li>
</ol>
